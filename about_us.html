      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Our journey began with a vision to simplify the investment process 
        and make it accessible to everyone. We recognized that many people struggle 
        with understanding complex financial concepts and making investment decisions 
        that align with their goals. With this in mind, we set out to create an investment 
        calculator website that would provide individuals with easy-to-use tools and 
        resources to help them make informed investment choices.
